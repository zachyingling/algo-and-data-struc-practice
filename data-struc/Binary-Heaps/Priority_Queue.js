// What is a Priority Queue?
// A data structure where each element has a priority.
// Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower
// priorities.

// Priority Queue is just an abstract concept. It can be done in many ways.
// Lots of the time priority queues are done using Binary Heaps due to speed and simplicity
