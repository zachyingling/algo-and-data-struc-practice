# Problem Solving Approach

## Objectives
* Devise a structured plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## Step 1 - Understand the Problem
* Can I restate the problem in my own words?
* What are the inputs that into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (Many not be able to answer question until you go about solving the problem)
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Step 2 - Concrete Examples
* Explore Examples
  * Start with Simple Examples
  * Progress to More Complex Examples
  * Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
  * Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

## Step 3 - Break It Down
* Explicitly write out he steps you need to take
  * This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

## Step 4 - Solve or Simplify
* Solve the problem
* If unable to solve the problem Simplify
  * Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  * Temporarily ignore that difficulty
  * Write a simplified solution
  * Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Step 5 - Look Back and Refactor
* Refactoring Questions
  * Can you check the result?
  * Can you derive the rsult differently?
  * Can you understand it at a glance?
  * Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  * Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  * Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  * How have other people solved this problem?
