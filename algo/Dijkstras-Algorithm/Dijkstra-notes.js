// Dijkstra's Algorithm

// Algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph

// One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around
// Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph
// "What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B"

// Edsger Disjkstra was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist, and all around smarty-pants
// He helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline
// Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to this day

// Useful for
// = GPS - finding fastest route
// = Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
// = Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
// = Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
// ...many other uses
